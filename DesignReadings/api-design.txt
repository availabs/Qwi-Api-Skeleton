    Device-Specific Wrappers
    Query-Based APIs

    Experience-Based API
        Combination of the above two.

    we have evolved our API into a platform for API development


    Supporting this platform are a few key philosophies:

        * Embrace the Differences of the Devices
        * Separate Content Gathering from Content Formatting/Delivery
        * Redefine the Border Between "Client" and "Server"
        * Distribute Innovation

    Each philosophy reflects our top-level goal: to provide whatever is best for the Netflix customer. 
    
    If we can improve the interaction between the API and our UIs, 
        we have a better chance of making more of our customers happier. 

    Our API development platform allows each UI team to create customized endpoints.

    Our new API has departed from the OSFA API model towards one that 
        enables fine-grained customizations without compromising overall system manageability. 
    To achieve this model, our new architecture clearly separates 
        the operations of content gathering from content formatting and delivery.
